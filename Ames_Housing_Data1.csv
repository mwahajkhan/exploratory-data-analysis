Update 3/14/24 - Looks like the link for the Python for Everybody (PFE) course is pointing to a different curriculum now. It has been updated to a new "Scientific Computing with Python (Beta)" course. Thus, to follow along with the blueprint you will need to use a different link to the Legacy course (which is perfectly fine for learning Python). That link is at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/python-for-everybody/.
